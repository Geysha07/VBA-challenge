# VBA-challenge

In this challenge, we created a VBA script that would loop through multiple spreadsheets, each containing a year of stock data in order to retrieve information. We wrote a script that would calculate the yearly change, percent change and total stock volume of each ticker, then printed the values on separate columns. Then we applied conditional formatting using VBA script that would highlight positive values green and negative values red on the yearly change and percent change columns. After that, we wrote a VBA script that would retrieve the tickers with the greatest % increase, greatest % decrease and greatest total volume and then printed the values on new columns.
